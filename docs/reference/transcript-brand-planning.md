Peter Moriarty: Yeah, we can join other events, but there are no events here, so someone has to do it. Eventually, she will. Yeah. Yeah. why do you want to be the instigator? clearly there's nothing happening here right now. and we've been here a year nearly.
Peter Moriarty: it's pretty lonely for me not having the high level entrepreneurs here. on the Gold Coast, I had people, more aligned or bigger businesses or people I could learn from. And it's not necessarily people that I would spend heaps of time with, but even just people to kind of be around is really good.
Peter Moriarty: And dance group is signed up. I don't think there's anyone there with more than five employees. Really? Yeah. They're all small business owners. Mhm. And they might have done things. Some of them might have had I don't know, decent careers or run big events or whatever, but no one's I didn't see I haven't met anyone there that's operating a significant business. I would say that most digital nomads are contractors. Yes. digital nomads, yes. But building a community, there'll be 10% that will get attracted to that community that are actual more decent business owners and that's who I'm interested in connecting with. Okay. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: So I kind of see it as a community that will be a bit of a magnet and feeding ground that I mean it creates a bit of position for us here which is nice to be known in the community that's cool. someone like Dan who knows us now we've built a relationship with now if someone rolls through and they're an absolute f** baller or they have a tech startup Dan is going to be feeding them my number right and I've given him heaps of advice and stuff to help him and resources and s*** so he's going to be doing whatever he can to help reciprocate and help me and that's basically I would love that if the whole town knows that we run entrepreneurship here and this is the destination to come to Mhm.
Peter Moriarty: M then yeah, when we have interesting highc caliber or just people that we want to be social friends with, matter where their business is at, people will connect them with us. and it's an attraction strategy. It's based on attraction strategy.  And those people might be just, social friends or people who do business with or they might be people who invite us to events or they might be people who connect us to other people. It might be the person who owns a sick boat. It might be a person who owns Sweettopia.
Peter Moriarty: but that's not the people we're attracting with this, no, but This is a connector network that leads to those kind of connections. I see what you're trying to do, but at the same time, in the back of my head, I'm thinking the digital nomads I know do not have those local connections.  because they'd be coming from somewhere else. They'll probably be here two months. yeah, it's not for me I wouldn't make that connection basically. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: And not saying that it's impossible. I think you're thinking about the individuals rather than if we have a community and a network. It gives us kind of access leverage reputation. Yeah. for example, Brianna talked about bringing successful entrepreneurs in and having them speak kind of thing at events. that's a cool thing to do.
00:05:00
Peter Moriarty: that's a cool thing to do for it's nice to be able to have that invitation opportunity. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.  I see that. yeah. is there a direct monetary gain? No, not necessarily. I mean we like to think of ourselves as high caliber people, And when we came to Calp and we wanted to find other people, did we look for? We looked for Calp digital nomads Facebook groups. That's what we looked for because we wanted to hang with entrepreneurs.
Peter Moriarty: So if we wanted to call it palp entrepreneurs and digital nomads we can do that to a certain extent we can vet people but also you want to get bombs on seats if there's events and things happening right and then you pick out who you like and if we're running for example a Facebook group which I don't know if that's necessarily the best place for everyone to hang out but WhatsApp  group is more likely where it'll be happening. But Facebook is good for discover that can be moderated fairly easily if people are in there just I'm a restaurant owner and here's the specials I have this week.
Peter Moriarty: you just* kick him out. It's really easy. Yeah. Okay. Do you want to talk about the brand? first I think we should get really clear about how much commitment do we want to put into something like this? maybe we just want to help Brianna out with a couple of events. maybe we don't need to have our own thing. But I don't know. we've been talking about this for years. So why are we resisting doing this or do you not want to build anything like this? Are you really happy just having your little girly friend group and that's enough for you? Because I know that's what you've done in other places. You haven't necessarily done something public. No. Yeah. Because I tend to do private invite only things but I don't have a funnel. I don't have a funnel.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I do. at heart I'm still an introvert.  M so are I like a more limited group that I see all the time rather than having public events where I have to get to know somebody new every single week.
Peter Moriarty: yeah, but I mean we are kind of natural community builders. So it might not be a big effort but yeah how often are we doing meetups or events and brands working?  What types of events do you want to do with her versus just Are we going to keep doing events ourselves and you said how much energy do we want to spend creating those events because it will take some energy. Yeah. Yeah. Even just inviting people. Of course. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: So, those are the types of things that I want to think of before we dive in. And maybe it doesn't have to be that complicated. Maybe we just need to let it, evolve as well. Is it recording? Okay. I think I do like the name C digital when we go to new places that is what we look for. yeah I think I'm also just remember that what about it the digital nomad spaces there were very old and
00:10:00
Peter Moriarty: M giving user advert. Yeah, it is like a dirt cheap place though, so it attracts people who don't have much money. there's a lot of proper broke packers there, people who don't have enough ticket homes. people wouldn't be able to survive here. It's too expensive. So you have to have some income to be. and Cal is quite affluent in that it's like retirement town now. It's a holiday spot. you can't live here in summer unless you've got proper money. Yeah. Or you score a year round rental. So, you have to be gainfully employed to survive here. Unless you're Spanish and you live up in your parents place or whatever and you work a service job, but it's not our target.
Peter Moriarty: I don't know if there's many digital nomads who would pick Calbe as their I don't think there is, but I do think that there would be enough people passing through or that might come here. I'm trying to think Do we want people who's passing through? I mean here for a month or something, Come to a couple events, I mean it's kind of like your German friend she was here but then potentially back again but thinking of coming to live here. That's the kind of passing through good or sometimes people come for summer for three months or Yeah. that's also good.
Peter Moriarty: but I was thinking if you're I don't know, a cyclist boyfriend girlfriend pair and you're here for a month or two training. M Yeah.  and you're, switched on, ambitious, young, savvy, that'd be cool to hang out with people like that. that's true. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: But also if you're here I don't know, maybe you're a competitive cyclist on the weekends and you're from somewhere else in Europe, you'll probably be petitioning to your job. Yeah, you might not be a founder, but you might be petitioning to your job and saying, "Hey, I want to work remotely for the next three months. I'm going to go train cycling in Calp every day and work."  You forgot Europeans have a lots of vacation days, So, they might just be vacationing. You think they might? That's possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's possible, too. They have at least 30 days of paid time off. That's how they're able to backpack through Asia and Australia, right? Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: we could open up the Facebook page and see what we attract. who's actually looking for these things. Yeah. Yeah. there's 200 people in that Marina Alta WhatsApp group and half of them are probably in the end. that does make sense. Yeah. yeah, it's surprising. There's just Seemingly zero happening. Yeah. But, if there was a ass event, if there was a kick-ass event in Aia or in Dena, then If there was an event with good reputation, we would go. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, we went to the one in Daniel. Yeah. So, my point being that people will come here if there are good events here. Mhm. And it could be** sunset founder tricks, right? But in a group that we curate, not a group, full of old real estate agents and, forex 4x people. okay. Sure. I'll be quick. Yeah, that's good. Yeah.
00:15:00
Peter Moriarty: the other thing we can do is we can set rules if we want. we can say no agents. the DC says, no recruiters because obviously a whole bunch of recruiters have gone in there and just, farmed everyone in the DC, So, we can say no agents for a forex company, no** real estate agents. And we can say no restaurant owners as well if we want. Yeah. They're not digital. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: The other thing is we could position it as Calpay founders if we wanted to. We could position it as Calpay entrepreneurs if we wanted to. There's a few different kind of positioning things we could do. Calpe founders would exclude anyone who's like a remote worker. So your friends don't feel like founders. And if they're digitally savvy and online workers I think I would want to have them in that community. If you need to use the L.  Yeah, they're more digital natives, not necessarily. Yeah, they're more remote workers than even digital nomads,
Peter Moriarty: So I guess just one more thing about this. My concern is when we say digital nomads, there will just be a bunch of remote workers and you might not be able to get what you're looking for in terms of your energy.  But now that I think of it, there were quite a few people on the dating apps who are founders. yeah, so maybe we just have to run one event and then you'll find all the founders that you've been wanting.
Peter Moriarty: yeah I think people like that peak guy from Dena if we ran good events people like that will show up. Yeah I think we should just do it. We don't want to overthink it.
Peter Moriarty: what do you think is the ideal first event? there's a million things we could do.** nights are great. I don't think we did that first because you got to have established that. we're going to do something like Coco just after hours. Sunset Founders drinks. Yeah. Entrepreneurs and digital nomads. Yeah. Yeah. That'll be easy. Very casual.
00:20:00
Peter Moriarty: we could and then we could do presentation. I don't know. we could if you're doing a little drinks question prompt cards are great for something like that. Prompted questions. Yeah. Yeah. yeah, we gota start making pub map already and promoting Making what? Publicity materials. Yeah. Yeah. Because if you want to do it next week. exactly. We basically have to start it this weekend. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: I think we have a big enough to pull it off. and we can just see on this first event who shows up.  M yeah. We got to do one fun thing though. What do you mean? I don't know. Something fun. We can do whatever the hell we want. It's our thing. we can make this what we want, babe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: But for a first event, it's gonna make a splash, I see. for the first thing. Okay. Yeah. It's gonna be something much time. People talk about " my god, that was so fun. I hope they do it again." the people that come to the event, mean? Okay, cool. Yeah. We can think of a way to entice them to come. something fun but not connection questions are great. so people come for education or excitement or whatever. They stay for connection. They stay for community. and when you put people in a room you get them connecting deeply with each other. that's how they stay.
Peter Moriarty: so yeah. So that's really easy to do. and that's really easy to fil finding and booking. I mean, we might just use Brianna space. that's probably the best thing to do. Yeah. Yeah. It's not really sunset drinks though, is it? No. No. Yeah. Because it would be nicer at a picturesque bar kind of thing.  And then people would dress up a bit and that want to make a bit of an impression. I would say we can meet at the wall but it's cold. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's not really the vibe. So some other ideas of stuff that we could do I like the idea of doing a founders walk like that idea.
Peter Moriarty: I like the idea of doing I mean even weekend activities might be a hike or something like that, or we could throw some sports in and things like that. sorry. Yeah. once we got a group of people Yeah. that's reasonably cool to hang out with. This would be pretty good. And I don't think we're going to get broke nomads here.  I think Asia attracts them because it's so cheap. I don't think broke nomads can survive here, babe. I don't think losers can survive here. I would say I'm sure there's one man bands who are like, but yeah, are we open to wannabes?
Peter Moriarty: remember in Coco when we went it's open for people who are just curious about the lifestyle are we open to that you're gonna have one or two rocking up you as long as they're not creeps it is what it is I think I'm just remembering that old lady she's a wannabe and I was like so what did he  too, I don't know. Yeah. yeah, there's always going to be one or two of them at a Greek party, and I think that's okay. we don't have to be stuck. Look, I get in little introvert wants to go into your shell kind of thing, but, it's a little bit of put on the extrovert when we run the event and that's all we need to do, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:25:00
Peter Moriarty: These are 67. we could commit to doing one event per month one every two months. yeah, we got the lunches with Dan.  I think there's something like for me even though sometimes on the day I'm like gh I committed to this why do I want to go and always loses every time I go to things like this it's actually always like cathartic group therapy because the people there get it like they get the f****** they get the s*** that you go through if you're actually running a business no matter if it's big or small it's still a f****** struggle.
Peter Moriarty: it's always a struggle. So that I really like. The* nights. my god, they were the best therapy. They were just fantastic. hearing other people lose hundreds of thousands of dollars was like, I feel less bad today." my god. That one time I joined, I think there was this lady two people who lost their entire business because of a bad contract. We'll get there.
Peter Moriarty: We'll get there. yeah, you're right. on Wednesday, I really did not want to go. I'm like, why taking me to the but then I'm there and I'm like, " okay. I do need to be here because I need a lot of practice." Yeah. Yeah. I felt the same about going on Wednesday and then I had a great time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. even more enjoyable than the first time even though I had less to say. It was weird. But you meet one person. those events, you talk to 30 people and you meet one person that's like, they're good. Yeah. I'm still waiting for that guy to reply to. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: His website didn't say business adventure group thing. So, let's do this. what? G  Some hot spiced wine. I've never heard of that before. It's a German thing. Mold wine, do you mean? mild wine. Yeah, That you only drink during the holidays. What if they're all like Dutch and British?
Peter Moriarty: they're probably going to be there. It's going to be s*** for a while. Look, if no one else builds this, it's not going to be here for us. And Brianna just wants to sell seats at her thing. She doesn't necessarily want to promote entrepreneurship for the good of some business groups. Yeah.  Yeah, a bit. yeah, I'm just thinking for example, Lisa and Caitlyn, they're not necessarily digital nomads. No. Yeah, they're tech savvy. they do some tech stuff.
Peter Moriarty: I don't know. Yeah, but they're not really into entrepreneurship. they're just working for other people and just having to work online. It's not really a remote worker. Yeah. It's not really their thing. Yeah. I don't think they'll be interested in joining this. they might be if it's someone inspiring speaking, then we would definitely invite them to that,  You're amazing. Love it. I'm totally aware of my, propensity to get excited about a new project and jump in and then get six months in and go like, what the f*** am I doing?
00:30:00
Peter Moriarty: So, I don't want to just build it for the sake of building it and I also don't want to take my energy off what's needed with it genius as well and pretty much about especially if we're not earlier what I said I'm not completely sure what the benefit is but I think it will be good for us to  community. Yeah. I'm just not How much time are we going to be spending on this? Mhm. Events would take up our whole afternoon for example. that's just delivering, planning takes Yeah. ages. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: the social thing, it would be better if we had, a crew of volunteers who wanted to help do it and had a vested interest in that. someone like a business coach who constantly needs leads of new entrepreneurs would be good. Do we want business coaches? Yeah. do we want the life coaches? god, there'll be quite a few here. We made a huge mistake. What relationship coaches? they're part of dance group. the old couple. They must be near Ela. they posted Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't chat to them. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, I didn't chat to him. No, we chatted to them when we were walking back Yeah. Yes. They say Digital nomads are a wide array of people.  the crypto bros, the Tik Tok influencers. You're talking me out of this. But, there can be some things we'd learn from them, like how they're building their cult.
Peter Moriarty: look, here's an argument for we met Lars and Nina. We had a nice weekend with them and we met Brent and Anastasia through them.  That's because of connecting with entrepreneurs. You and I was just lucky that LZ put himself out there on the Facebook groups that we found him. if there was actually a decent group for entrepreneurs, even if it was online only, even if it was online and WhatsApp only, then we'll be able to connect with people like that. And that's a good thing. I guess so.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, I like Brandon Anastasia. I not so much. Yeah, I know. but that's my point. We only met Brent Anastasia because we met LZ and Nina. That's true. We wouldn't have met them otherwise. Yeah, I'm saying let's do it. Okay. That's what I keep saying. we should map out what it looks like and we can do that It's 7 minutes to 4. I think that Facebook group and a WhatsApp Facebook group and a WhatsApp group. I think we told that we have this brand. And that we'll be doing the events in partnership with them and then we can decide what we want to do with the group. Building it up. Yeah. yeah. After the first event like Okay.
00:35:00
Peter Moriarty: Yeah. what did the person look like? are you willing to spend all day every single night to do this thing? you still like Cel Digital? No, I think that's a good name. There's a publication called Cal Digital. It's CalDigital.  It's got 10,000 followers on Facebook. so it's reasonably well established and it's an English digital newspaper. There's also Benadorm digital digital like they've done the whole Marina Ala. I kind of don't give a f***. I want to launch this anyway because it's different enough that it doesn't matter. Digital number. What do you mean? You already have the domain, right? Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: they've got kelp digital.es and I think cult.com. so is there ice cream or did we finish it off? I think we finished. I haven't seen your ice creams. yeah.  So just mindful there is a tiny bit of crossover with that. but if I like cup I really like cup digital because it's broad enough that you could be an online marketer, you could be just techsavvy and then we control the guardrails. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: yeah, we control the guard rails for who we want to lead in. So yeah, so let's go forth with Cal Digital. But on the Facebook name, I think Ca Digital Nomads would still be better. Calp digital nomads and entrepreneurs would be the Facebook. Yeah, but the admin can be top digital. and I think it was you that text me and said the people of New York type things. humans of it went big. Yeah. Yeah. And they were just posting people's photos and then stories. There's also humans of Amsterdam. it's one of everywhere. I know what we could do. every now and again I catch up with a coffee or lunch with someone, Mhm. Interesting. Your dates, mean? Sorry. Some of them.
Peter Moriarty: but I mean specifically if I catch up with entrepreneurs, your day yesterday, I put the recording down, record the conversation that I've got transcribed AI. Boom, there's the text. Take my camera, snap a photo, boom, digital nomads of C. And people love to be profiled.  Yeah. And I don't have to do any journalistic effort. I just record transcribe it, and then put it into Gemini. But you have to find the gem in the five minutes. What do you mean find the relatable quote? I can get that. That's easy. I can get that.
Peter Moriarty: I'm trying to work out what could I do that's useful content wise where I don't have to change what I would do any zero effort right yeah I always go for walks with people and meet with people so that will be easy I get one of those little DJI things and just click to both of us go for a walk and we can record to the device you don't even need a camera so you could just both get audio
Peter Moriarty: talking to people some accounts interview. you and how much of this this went Got to be careful of time.  I absolutely do not want to do this solo. I just went, what I don't see you going for hourong walks with people. I like doing that. You're a lesson to that. I think it would be fun for us to host a podcast. So, people on couch in the co-working space and then record a podcast.
00:40:00
Peter Moriarty: the river, the ad things. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Yeah. Exactly. And what would be cool about that is everyone wants snippets of them on a podcast to their socials, So they would totally come because we say the package is you get your interview, Publicity exposure get snipped up. Yeah. we can make this a hub in 12 months and then people will come here remember 12 months ago we were googling digital nomads cap and nothing came up. you imagine if you were tossing up between Javier Dia Cape Benadorm Ala Marro and you type in digital nomads cap and it's** thriving you're going to come here. Do we want all those people?
Peter Moriarty: If we attract high quality people, yes, of course. but babe, we put that in our positioning. This conversation is going into AI to build our strategy and we will build this into our positioning. Let's attract people that we want to be around. Yes. Let's make that our thing. Easy. I do like that idea. Yeah. We get to make the rules, babe. We don't have to put up with anyone that we don't want to put up with.  and maybe one or two out of 10. But we can they're public events. That's just how it is. But we can put guard rails in place, Yeah. I don't know. Maybe you charge €20 for each event and then it puts exclusivity. It gets rid of the cheap B freeloaders.
Peter Moriarty: that's a fun project we could run together. It is 4:00. You better go here. I'll review some content. do you mind turning on this big live? Sure..
