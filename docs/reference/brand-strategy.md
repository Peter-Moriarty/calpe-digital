Transcript
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, we can join other events, but there are no events here, so someone has to do it. Eventually, she will. Yeah. Yeah. why do you want to be the instigator? clearly there's nothing happening here right now. and we've been here a year nearly.
Peter Moriarty: it's pretty lonely for me not having the high level entrepreneurs here. on the Gold Coast, I had people, more aligned or bigger businesses or people I could learn from. And it's not necessarily people that I would spend heaps of time with, but even just people to kind of be around is really good.
Peter Moriarty: And dance group is signed up. I don't think there's anyone there with more than five employees. Really? Yeah. They're all small business owners. Mhm. And they might have done things. Some of them might have had I don't know, decent careers or run big events or whatever, but no one's I didn't see I haven't met anyone there that's operating a significant business. I would say that most digital nomads are contractors. Yes. digital nomads, yes. But building a community, there'll be 10% that will get attracted to that community that are actual more decent business owners and that's who I'm interested in connecting with. Okay. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: So I kind of see it as a community that will be a bit of a magnet and feeding ground that I mean it creates a bit of position for us here which is nice to be known in the community that's cool. someone like Dan who knows us now we've built a relationship with now if someone rolls through and they're an absolute f** baller or they have a tech startup Dan is going to be feeding them my number right and I've given him heaps of advice and stuff to help him and resources and s*** so he's going to be doing whatever he can to help reciprocate and help me and that's basically I would love that if the whole town knows that we run entrepreneurship here and this is the destination to come to Mhm.
Peter Moriarty: M then yeah, when we have interesting highc caliber or just people that we want to be social friends with, matter where their business is at, people will connect them with us. and it's an attraction strategy. It's based on attraction strategy.  And those people might be just, social friends or people who do business with or they might be people who invite us to events or they might be people who connect us to other people. It might be the person who owns a sick boat. It might be a person who owns Sweettopia.
Peter Moriarty: but that's not the people we're attracting with this, no, but This is a connector network that leads to those kind of connections. I see what you're trying to do, but at the same time, in the back of my head, I'm thinking the digital nomads I know do not have those local connections.  because they'd be coming from somewhere else. They'll probably be here two months. yeah, it's not for me I wouldn't make that connection basically. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: And not saying that it's impossible. I think you're thinking about the individuals rather than if we have a community and a network. It gives us kind of access leverage reputation. Yeah. for example, Brianna talked about bringing successful entrepreneurs in and having them speak kind of thing at events. that's a cool thing to do.
00:05:00
Peter Moriarty: that's a cool thing to do for it's nice to be able to have that invitation opportunity. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.  I see that. yeah. is there a direct monetary gain? No, not necessarily. I mean we like to think of ourselves as high caliber people, And when we came to Calp and we wanted to find other people, did we look for? We looked for Calp digital nomads Facebook groups. That's what we looked for because we wanted to hang with entrepreneurs.
Peter Moriarty: So if we wanted to call it palp entrepreneurs and digital nomads we can do that to a certain extent we can vet people but also you want to get bombs on seats if there's events and things happening right and then you pick out who you like and if we're running for example a Facebook group which I don't know if that's necessarily the best place for everyone to hang out but WhatsApp  group is more likely where it'll be happening. But Facebook is good for discover that can be moderated fairly easily if people are in there just I'm a restaurant owner and here's the specials I have this week.
Peter Moriarty: you just* kick him out. It's really easy. Yeah. Okay. Do you want to talk about the brand? first I think we should get really clear about how much commitment do we want to put into something like this? maybe we just want to help Brianna out with a couple of events. maybe we don't need to have our own thing. But I don't know. we've been talking about this for years. So why are we resisting doing this or do you not want to build anything like this? Are you really happy just having your little girly friend group and that's enough for you? Because I know that's what you've done in other places. You haven't necessarily done something public. No. Yeah. Because I tend to do private invite only things but I don't have a funnel. I don't have a funnel.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I do. at heart I'm still an introvert.  M so are I like a more limited group that I see all the time rather than having public events where I have to get to know somebody new every single week.
Peter Moriarty: yeah, but I mean we are kind of natural community builders. So it might not be a big effort but yeah how often are we doing meetups or events and brands working?  What types of events do you want to do with her versus just Are we going to keep doing events ourselves and you said how much energy do we want to spend creating those events because it will take some energy. Yeah. Yeah. Even just inviting people. Of course. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: So, those are the types of things that I want to think of before we dive in. And maybe it doesn't have to be that complicated. Maybe we just need to let it, evolve as well. Is it recording? Okay. I think I do like the name C digital when we go to new places that is what we look for. yeah I think I'm also just remember that what about it the digital nomad spaces there were very old and
00:10:00
Peter Moriarty: M giving user advert. Yeah, it is like a dirt cheap place though, so it attracts people who don't have much money. there's a lot of proper broke packers there, people who don't have enough ticket homes. people wouldn't be able to survive here. It's too expensive. So you have to have some income to be. and Cal is quite affluent in that it's like retirement town now. It's a holiday spot. you can't live here in summer unless you've got proper money. Yeah. Or you score a year round rental. So, you have to be gainfully employed to survive here. Unless you're Spanish and you live up in your parents place or whatever and you work a service job, but it's not our target.
Peter Moriarty: I don't know if there's many digital nomads who would pick Calbe as their I don't think there is, but I do think that there would be enough people passing through or that might come here. I'm trying to think Do we want people who's passing through? I mean here for a month or something, Come to a couple events, I mean it's kind of like your German friend she was here but then potentially back again but thinking of coming to live here. That's the kind of passing through good or sometimes people come for summer for three months or Yeah. that's also good.
Peter Moriarty: but I was thinking if you're I don't know, a cyclist boyfriend girlfriend pair and you're here for a month or two training. M Yeah.  and you're, switched on, ambitious, young, savvy, that'd be cool to hang out with people like that. that's true. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: But also if you're here I don't know, maybe you're a competitive cyclist on the weekends and you're from somewhere else in Europe, you'll probably be petitioning to your job. Yeah, you might not be a founder, but you might be petitioning to your job and saying, "Hey, I want to work remotely for the next three months. I'm going to go train cycling in Calp every day and work."  You forgot Europeans have a lots of vacation days, So, they might just be vacationing. You think they might? That's possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's possible, too. They have at least 30 days of paid time off. That's how they're able to backpack through Asia and Australia, right? Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: we could open up the Facebook page and see what we attract. who's actually looking for these things. Yeah. Yeah. there's 200 people in that Marina Alta WhatsApp group and half of them are probably in the end. that does make sense. Yeah. yeah, it's surprising. There's just Seemingly zero happening. Yeah. But, if there was a ass event, if there was a kick-ass event in Aia or in Dena, then If there was an event with good reputation, we would go. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, we went to the one in Daniel. Yeah. So, my point being that people will come here if there are good events here. Mhm. And it could be** sunset founder tricks, right? But in a group that we curate, not a group, full of old real estate agents and, forex 4x people. okay. Sure. I'll be quick. Yeah, that's good. Yeah.
00:15:00
Peter Moriarty: the other thing we can do is we can set rules if we want. we can say no agents. the DC says, no recruiters because obviously a whole bunch of recruiters have gone in there and just, farmed everyone in the DC, So, we can say no agents for a forex company, no** real estate agents. And we can say no restaurant owners as well if we want. Yeah. They're not digital. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: The other thing is we could position it as Calpay founders if we wanted to. We could position it as Calpay entrepreneurs if we wanted to. There's a few different kind of positioning things we could do. Calpe founders would exclude anyone who's like a remote worker. So your friends don't feel like founders. And if they're digitally savvy and online workers I think I would want to have them in that community. If you need to use the L.  Yeah, they're more digital natives, not necessarily. Yeah, they're more remote workers than even digital nomads,
Peter Moriarty: So I guess just one more thing about this. My concern is when we say digital nomads, there will just be a bunch of remote workers and you might not be able to get what you're looking for in terms of your energy.  But now that I think of it, there were quite a few people on the dating apps who are founders. yeah, so maybe we just have to run one event and then you'll find all the founders that you've been wanting.
Peter Moriarty: yeah I think people like that peak guy from Dena if we ran good events people like that will show up. Yeah I think we should just do it. We don't want to overthink it.
Peter Moriarty: what do you think is the ideal first event? there's a million things we could do.** nights are great. I don't think we did that first because you got to have established that. we're going to do something like Coco just after hours. Sunset Founders drinks. Yeah. Entrepreneurs and digital nomads. Yeah. Yeah. That'll be easy. Very casual.
00:20:00
Peter Moriarty: we could and then we could do presentation. I don't know. we could if you're doing a little drinks question prompt cards are great for something like that. Prompted questions. Yeah. Yeah. yeah, we gota start making pub map already and promoting Making what? Publicity materials. Yeah. Yeah. Because if you want to do it next week. exactly. We basically have to start it this weekend. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: I think we have a big enough to pull it off. and we can just see on this first event who shows up.  M yeah. We got to do one fun thing though. What do you mean? I don't know. Something fun. We can do whatever the hell we want. It's our thing. we can make this what we want, babe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: But for a first event, it's gonna make a splash, I see. for the first thing. Okay. Yeah. It's gonna be something much time. People talk about " my god, that was so fun. I hope they do it again." the people that come to the event, mean? Okay, cool. Yeah. We can think of a way to entice them to come. something fun but not connection questions are great. so people come for education or excitement or whatever. They stay for connection. They stay for community. and when you put people in a room you get them connecting deeply with each other. that's how they stay.
Peter Moriarty: so yeah. So that's really easy to do. and that's really easy to fil finding and booking. I mean, we might just use Brianna space. that's probably the best thing to do. Yeah. Yeah. It's not really sunset drinks though, is it? No. No. Yeah. Because it would be nicer at a picturesque bar kind of thing.  And then people would dress up a bit and that want to make a bit of an impression. I would say we can meet at the wall but it's cold. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's not really the vibe. So some other ideas of stuff that we could do I like the idea of doing a founders walk like that idea.
Peter Moriarty: I like the idea of doing I mean even weekend activities might be a hike or something like that, or we could throw some sports in and things like that. sorry. Yeah. once we got a group of people Yeah. that's reasonably cool to hang out with. This would be pretty good. And I don't think we're going to get broke nomads here.  I think Asia attracts them because it's so cheap. I don't think broke nomads can survive here, babe. I don't think losers can survive here. I would say I'm sure there's one man bands who are like, but yeah, are we open to wannabes?
Peter Moriarty: remember in Coco when we went it's open for people who are just curious about the lifestyle are we open to that you're gonna have one or two rocking up you as long as they're not creeps it is what it is I think I'm just remembering that old lady she's a wannabe and I was like so what did he  too, I don't know. Yeah. yeah, there's always going to be one or two of them at a Greek party, and I think that's okay. we don't have to be stuck. Look, I get in little introvert wants to go into your shell kind of thing, but, it's a little bit of put on the extrovert when we run the event and that's all we need to do, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:25:00
Peter Moriarty: These are 67. we could commit to doing one event per month one every two months. yeah, we got the lunches with Dan.  I think there's something like for me even though sometimes on the day I'm like gh I committed to this why do I want to go and always loses every time I go to things like this it's actually always like cathartic group therapy because the people there get it like they get the f****** they get the s*** that you go through if you're actually running a business no matter if it's big or small it's still a f****** struggle.
Peter Moriarty: it's always a struggle. So that I really like. The* nights. my god, they were the best therapy. They were just fantastic. hearing other people lose hundreds of thousands of dollars was like, I feel less bad today." my god. That one time I joined, I think there was this lady two people who lost their entire business because of a bad contract. We'll get there.
Peter Moriarty: We'll get there. yeah, you're right. on Wednesday, I really did not want to go. I'm like, why taking me to the but then I'm there and I'm like, " okay. I do need to be here because I need a lot of practice." Yeah. Yeah. I felt the same about going on Wednesday and then I had a great time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. even more enjoyable than the first time even though I had less to say. It was weird. But you meet one person. those events, you talk to 30 people and you meet one person that's like, they're good. Yeah. I'm still waiting for that guy to reply to. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: His website didn't say business adventure group thing. So, let's do this. what? G  Some hot spiced wine. I've never heard of that before. It's a German thing. Mold wine, do you mean? mild wine. Yeah, That you only drink during the holidays. What if they're all like Dutch and British?
Peter Moriarty: they're probably going to be there. It's going to be s*** for a while. Look, if no one else builds this, it's not going to be here for us. And Brianna just wants to sell seats at her thing. She doesn't necessarily want to promote entrepreneurship for the good of some business groups. Yeah.  Yeah, a bit. yeah, I'm just thinking for example, Lisa and Caitlyn, they're not necessarily digital nomads. No. Yeah, they're tech savvy. they do some tech stuff.
Peter Moriarty: I don't know. Yeah, but they're not really into entrepreneurship. they're just working for other people and just having to work online. It's not really a remote worker. Yeah. It's not really their thing. Yeah. I don't think they'll be interested in joining this. they might be if it's someone inspiring speaking, then we would definitely invite them to that,  You're amazing. Love it. I'm totally aware of my, propensity to get excited about a new project and jump in and then get six months in and go like, what the f*** am I doing?
00:30:00
Peter Moriarty: So, I don't want to just build it for the sake of building it and I also don't want to take my energy off what's needed with it genius as well and pretty much about especially if we're not earlier what I said I'm not completely sure what the benefit is but I think it will be good for us to  community. Yeah. I'm just not How much time are we going to be spending on this? Mhm. Events would take up our whole afternoon for example. that's just delivering, planning takes Yeah. ages. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: the social thing, it would be better if we had, a crew of volunteers who wanted to help do it and had a vested interest in that. someone like a business coach who constantly needs leads of new entrepreneurs would be good. Do we want business coaches? Yeah. do we want the life coaches? god, there'll be quite a few here. We made a huge mistake. What relationship coaches? they're part of dance group. the old couple. They must be near Ela. they posted Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't chat to them. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, I didn't chat to him. No, we chatted to them when we were walking back Yeah. Yes. They say Digital nomads are a wide array of people.  the crypto bros, the Tik Tok influencers. You're talking me out of this. But, there can be some things we'd learn from them, like how they're building their cult.
Peter Moriarty: look, here's an argument for we met Lars and Nina. We had a nice weekend with them and we met Brent and Anastasia through them.  That's because of connecting with entrepreneurs. You and I was just lucky that LZ put himself out there on the Facebook groups that we found him. if there was actually a decent group for entrepreneurs, even if it was online only, even if it was online and WhatsApp only, then we'll be able to connect with people like that. And that's a good thing. I guess so.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, I like Brandon Anastasia. I not so much. Yeah, I know. but that's my point. We only met Brent Anastasia because we met LZ and Nina. That's true. We wouldn't have met them otherwise. Yeah, I'm saying let's do it. Okay. That's what I keep saying. we should map out what it looks like and we can do that It's 7 minutes to 4. I think that Facebook group and a WhatsApp Facebook group and a WhatsApp group. I think we told that we have this brand. And that we'll be doing the events in partnership with them and then we can decide what we want to do with the group. Building it up. Yeah. yeah. After the first event like Okay.
00:35:00
Peter Moriarty: Yeah. what did the person look like? are you willing to spend all day every single night to do this thing? you still like Cel Digital? No, I think that's a good name. There's a publication called Cal Digital. It's CalDigital.  It's got 10,000 followers on Facebook. so it's reasonably well established and it's an English digital newspaper. There's also Benadorm digital digital like they've done the whole Marina Ala. I kind of don't give a f***. I want to launch this anyway because it's different enough that it doesn't matter. Digital number. What do you mean? You already have the domain, right? Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: they've got kelp digital.es and I think cult.com. so is there ice cream or did we finish it off? I think we finished. I haven't seen your ice creams. yeah.  So just mindful there is a tiny bit of crossover with that. but if I like cup I really like cup digital because it's broad enough that you could be an online marketer, you could be just techsavvy and then we control the guardrails. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: yeah, we control the guard rails for who we want to lead in. So yeah, so let's go forth with Cal Digital. But on the Facebook name, I think Ca Digital Nomads would still be better. Calp digital nomads and entrepreneurs would be the Facebook. Yeah, but the admin can be top digital. and I think it was you that text me and said the people of New York type things. humans of it went big. Yeah. Yeah. And they were just posting people's photos and then stories. There's also humans of Amsterdam. it's one of everywhere. I know what we could do. every now and again I catch up with a coffee or lunch with someone, Mhm. Interesting. Your dates, mean? Sorry. Some of them.
Peter Moriarty: but I mean specifically if I catch up with entrepreneurs, your day yesterday, I put the recording down, record the conversation that I've got transcribed AI. Boom, there's the text. Take my camera, snap a photo, boom, digital nomads of C. And people love to be profiled.  Yeah. And I don't have to do any journalistic effort. I just record transcribe it, and then put it into Gemini. But you have to find the gem in the five minutes. What do you mean find the relatable quote? I can get that. That's easy. I can get that.
Peter Moriarty: I'm trying to work out what could I do that's useful content wise where I don't have to change what I would do any zero effort right yeah I always go for walks with people and meet with people so that will be easy I get one of those little DJI things and just click to both of us go for a walk and we can record to the device you don't even need a camera so you could just both get audio
Peter Moriarty: talking to people some accounts interview. you and how much of this this went Got to be careful of time.  I absolutely do not want to do this solo. I just went, what I don't see you going for hourong walks with people. I like doing that. You're a lesson to that. I think it would be fun for us to host a podcast. So, people on couch in the co-working space and then record a podcast.
00:40:00
Peter Moriarty: the river, the ad things. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Yeah. Exactly. And what would be cool about that is everyone wants snippets of them on a podcast to their socials, So they would totally come because we say the package is you get your interview, Publicity exposure get snipped up. Yeah. we can make this a hub in 12 months and then people will come here remember 12 months ago we were googling digital nomads cap and nothing came up. you imagine if you were tossing up between Javier Dia Cape Benadorm Ala Marro and you type in digital nomads cap and it's** thriving you're going to come here. Do we want all those people?
Peter Moriarty: If we attract high quality people, yes, of course. but babe, we put that in our positioning. This conversation is going into AI to build our strategy and we will build this into our positioning. Let's attract people that we want to be around. Yes. Let's make that our thing. Easy. I do like that idea. Yeah. We get to make the rules, babe. We don't have to put up with anyone that we don't want to put up with.  and maybe one or two out of 10. But we can they're public events. That's just how it is. But we can put guard rails in place, Yeah. I don't know. Maybe you charge €20 for each event and then it puts exclusivity. It gets rid of the cheap B freeloaders.

Transcript
Peter Moriarty: I'm just going to record and then we have a transcription, Okay, perfect. Yeah. So, you're going to be busy running the space and so yeah, if we can help and I guess it's a good relationship for both of us because we've been talking about creating a community here for nearly a year since we got here. because when we got here there was nothing.
Peter Moriarty: There's nothing. Yeah. And it's such a beautiful place to live. when we go to a new place, you usually search for the place name and then digital. and I think there's one in maybe definitely. Yeah. But not really that on Facebook that doesn't work. Is dead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Somebody tried to do what we're trying to do and then laugh probably. Yeah. And you want to do this because the digital nomads because it's something that you really want to mostly we want to have friends. I want to introduce you to Gabrielle and the Canadian or Yeah. please introduce them. Exactly. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: that's exactly they are from Canada and they've been here for one year is they say the state. Okay, please. Yeah. Yeah, you'll have to do a group chat. Yeah, I think mostly we want to Yeah, we'd like to have some friends here. so my business is it, right? Our customers are all over the world. I don't need to sign up customers one by one here. So, I don't really need customers that way.  I think for me it's a little bit kind of like giving back. I enjoy that. but also I guess the psychological reward is I like to be known in the community. that's what I like, So that's a good feeling, right? Yeah. That's the payoff for me, of course.
Peter Moriarty: TZ, I guess you've got the potential to get some business like people who want to hire in the Philippines. Maybe but it would also just be great to be around business owners because I'm a new business owner and it's just good to be in that energy.  m. So for you like inspiration, education, network, but you're focusing to doing something for entrepreneurs or for digital moment. I mean not talking about business so different subset or do you have something specific in your mind? Yeah, we were thinking about that today. We were trying to find exactly who we want to target.
Peter Moriarty: is it all remote workers, is it digital nomads or is it just founders? so we kind of settled on founders and digital nomads. so more like tech digital entrepreneurship. Yeah, because we already have some of that with the other business groups that we're in.  We had one business brunch to this week on Wednesday and so we are already getting some of that we are part of the business community around here the general business community and we want this to be more tech specific I would say. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Peter Moriarty: as you have asked for what you pursue doing this I think for me it's very clear I want to not only create a nice space is an space that that's why I create this for the people and I want to this come alive with activities events and if I introduce Gabrielle because you're new here it's something that touched my  hard to bring people together because I'm brainer and that touched my heart very closely and for the business because they could be potential buyers here. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: And for me it's really being like one of my dream is to this not at the working it's like inter I hope for international entrepreneurs that would be great that the next startup creat people say don't start a working space if you want to make money it has to be about the community and about being a hub and  I've been in other startup hubs. I'm from S Sydney is an excellent startup hub. So, Canvas started in Sydney. and yeah, and I met the co-founders. they're friends of friends. And it's very inspiring to have a startup from my country be international succumbs thinking about that, for that to be an international success, I'm very very proud of that. And they're from my city as well.
00:05:00
Peter Moriarty: Atlassian, they're a big IT tech company, but they're from Sydney as well. and sometimes you might see the founder walking down the street in Sydney. So that's a nice thing. so I like the energy of a community and a hub that can be created.  And I remember when I visited Bali for example in Ubud, there were good co-working spaces there and it was a little bit too much Bali for me. it was very like barefoot all the time. not really my style, but I could see how much the community loved that hub and that was really cool.
Peter Moriarty: So, we were talking today what's the avatar of the people that are here of the customer and it's a little bit more affluent here because there's not a cheap area here. it costs money to be here. So, you can't be here and be barefoot on the beach all day.  But I'm hoping if we have European people visiting from all different areas or maybe they're here they're a cyclist right and they're here for two months training but they want somewhere to work from. I think that's a good customer that's a good customer and I think there'll be either professionals or hopefully as you say entrepreneurs that might start something here and make something significant. that would be really cool. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: I'm just thinking now that this place will be attracting Spanish people who are here with their family but they still have to work and they don't want to work in the family house for some reason why I think that's also a good market or a good avatar to target. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.  And that's what I'm doing for I think I explain you for the people because for me it's easier doing in Spanish and then create something like that. it's fine from people from here.
Peter Moriarty: We have the next event on Wednesday that is for entrepreneurs or people who wants to create their company or they need inspiration because it's really challenge to create something to be motivator each single day with all the problems that comes for you and maybe do something like that for the digital dma I'm so new I don't have any knowledge at all because I haven't been digital nomad so for me it's more easy from the other side to do it on the other hand better great Z is a digital nomad expert she's in all the groups she knows digital nomads all over the world Z's is an expert in that culture okay great yeah I need a water would you like a
Peter Moriarty: we have here that's we can help with that. Yeah. So I think each of us have something to add. So that's very important to and I think about what you explaining the things that you want to have as a result of doing this. I think we are on the same page.  So, it's like what we going to do How we going to the other thing I'll add, when's the event? It's Wednesday. Did you say there's an event? In the afternoon. make I'm not sure if I'm going to continue doing this. I'm not sure. Is the fifth time there. Okay. Why do you think you say the same thing?
Peter Moriarty: because sometimes it's really hard to bring the people but it's weird because I don't publicity this I just do it with people that I know okay do you want to come yeah I want to go I don't announce on Instagram not all of them for example this one not because when I started for it was for create a community before this place gotcha  But it doesn't work as I thought because my objective was not only the community but potential clients to have really and when the moment arrived they didn't need a working space.
00:10:00
Peter Moriarty: M it was like okay I don't know if I'm going to still doing this because it's the same people who normally comes because if I don't adi advice is normal that they always going to have the same people because it's free I'm doing everything just by myself and it takes time a lot of effort we're talking about this a lot of effort energy because I
Peter Moriarty: have to prepare everything because I bring alcohol and I prepare the publicity and look for the people who I'm going to interview and then the social media everything is a lot and for me it was like okay maybe this is going to be the last time I don't know but my husband tell me you always say that it's going to be the last time so I don't know I don't know let's think because this
Peter Moriarty: This is the first time that we're going to do it here with the work in space finish. I don't know if that going to Maybe it feels different now. Yeah. maybe we can also bring some additional energy and encouragement. and we can help a little bit as well. Would you like to come? course. it's on my calendar. We're coming. But it's in Spanish.  I don't know. I was going to ask. definitely. Okay. Yeah, it's like very local people. I mean, we can listen. That's good practicing. It's gonna be a completely different level of Spanish that we're at. It's business Spanish.  Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: normally it's we are here couple of friends speaking something and I invite them to introduce themselves but not only to say hi I'm Brianda is if I can have a professional wish what would be for example professional superpower and I say okay my name is Banda my business is
Peter Moriarty: co-working space and my super power professional superpower that will choose have so many little birandas like your chance of community, your chance of events, your chance of sales for example and then they gave me I made brainstorming about what they need in their business and they say okay I need someone to help me to put focus
Peter Moriarty: because normally it's easy to get distracted but everything you have to do and someone for example who's starting says okay I have problems too with the prices because I don't know if it's too high if it's too low and we need help each other and then I made mini groups where each one says what is the challenge that they have because normally it's too easy from the
Peter Moriarty: other side and you tell me for example I have a problem with my team it's difficult to control them do you have that problem with your company and I advise you okay I will do this or I did this in your same situation and then we have the interview with the person that I invite that tell us their story how they start and everything sounds amazing that sounds great that's like the program that perform
Peter Moriarty: The format and then in the middle we are drinking wine business club. but not a serious one and then we eat something. Great. That's the format. That sounds fantastic. Maybe if you want to we can try something for digital nomad. But as I told you, I prefer listening your ideas because I don't know anything about digital moments.  So I think it will be better listen from you. What do you think they need? Yeah. I think there's lots of different I think have you already told her about the partnership idea? just that we're building community that's Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: So, we already have the pages and we're thinking of building it up the groups the WhatsApp community called Cal Digital and so we'll be the digital nomad partner to your co-workers basically.  And so you can run your business events if you want to continue it. But then our events will be more digital nomad focus founders more specific to tech And we'll call them and basically they'll be collaborative events. So it'll be our brand together. Cafe Partners and Cafe Digital together.
00:15:00
Peter Moriarty: And I think because you'll have your audience your community and then we'll have ours and then when we run an event then we bring them that will be nice in they some hopefully. Yeah exactly. because I guess this will be a bit of a home for the community at least for people to working in events and you've got an amazing event space here as well. that would be really cool for us to be running events and we're hoping that if we run really good events we can bring people from Javier we can bring people from Dena from Ala and then who young people they move from place to place right so maybe the next time they're picking a new rental maybe they'll choose to come in cap and maybe they'll take up a seat here in a membership.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, that would be nice and normally there was a girl yesterday that sent me a message through LinkedIn. it was unexpected, let's say. And she told me that she's a digital nomad and she's in Asia right now. Cool. She's thinking to come to Spain okay I just saw your working space. Nice.  There's digital nom over there because the first question that normally the digital na has in mind I think it's like who is there? Yeah. Because they don't want to be by themselves. We need a YouTube channel. We need a We need a blog. Enable because We were searching digital nomads car this and there' We found a walking tour and there was nothing else. Okay.
Peter Moriarty: Okay, we're going to do Okay, you can focus on or maybe if you want to do it look at the big rock working space.  today normally it's alante thing that we have and I don't know if you're interested in Costalanca as well or maybe not only Calpe Costank is like we just care about Cal we want everyone to come to Cal because we don't drive we don't want to drive anywhere
Peter Moriarty: Yeah. Are they here? Yeah. It's up to them if they want to come or not. pal who visited with me the other day, right? She's in the tachel. She said she's been to the coins in Kenya in Java, but she said that this is much nicer than those things. So if people want to drive to here, we let them. I understand. Of course. so that's the idea. And then you want to share our ideas for the first event? So, there's lots of things we can do. We only have a week before we go. So, that makes things challenging, but there's lots of events that are already tried and tested in co-working spaces and communities all over the world. So, this is very easy for us. Okay. We can do f***** nights.
Peter Moriarty: We can do networking. We can do a social sunset drinks maybe outside, at a bar somewhere. we can do co-founder speed dating. That's a good one. not for dating that to find business partners, people you might do business with. Language exchange. mentoring. I like that. That's a good one. You can do a  So business hot seat is a mastermind but you put one person in the hot seat they explain their business problem and then for 10 minutes they get suggestions from everyone. Yeah that's a nice one because what I did is mastermind but with groups separately different stuff. Yeah one week mastermind onee hot seed. nice getting a guest presenter in you're already doing that. that's a fantastic one.
Peter Moriarty: but just I think what I know is it's lonely being an entrepreneur when you don't have community. When I was to the summit that you saw the flyer yeah one. Yes. Yeah. I went to the first one I think it was this year in Aleante. Yeah.  And there was a girl who was the presenter and she was telling normally for a digital nom the first question is like I told you before is who is there? If there is a community there is people or because it gets lonely after you've been traveling for two three years you kind of just want to go to a place and have friends waiting for you there. Okay. Yeah.
00:20:00
Peter Moriarty: So, I think that there's a lot of interesting that we can two Double doors. It's so loud in here. It needs I do like I can fill the Facebook if we spam other groups around the area and say, "Hey, this is a group we're  Click here to join the Facebook group. And we have a couple application questions to fill out. and then have you messaged the person for the marina community? No, I didn't yet. Actually, I'll do it with my brain switched on.
Peter Moriarty: I don't want to rush that message because half the girls in my friend group are working remotely. There's one real estate agent. Yeah. Are they digital enough? There's a couple of trying to be influencers. Project creators will be welcome. Yeah. Yeah.  I think yeah that's our piece actually we have to invite content creators influencers or those test some people who are accounted me by Instagram and all those stuff and one of them there's a girl who test me a photograph and she did really nice photos and she told me for your next event please tell me and I will do the photos for free for
Peter Moriarty: So, the president, we have the photos. I'm Good with camera as Yeah. Yeah. Cool. I can shoot some video. I want to say we also want the local influencers here. where am I going today? Who are here? I have a friend who's called Lydia has a strong community.  Mhm. She's a yoga teacher and she made several events here and in other countries like Indonesia, Moro and all and so we can invite her to be part to come one of events and I can ask her because she's my friend. Please you can post it and she'll do it.
Peter Moriarty: And is that Lydia or else from community here in Ge specifically? No, I think just the other areas maybe even Alejand invite people but we can do some research like search the hashtags and see what accounts there we'll do some research and create a prospect list. what are your thoughts on
Peter Moriarty: English versus Spanish in the events. because obviously that, we're going to have a mix, but you're going to have some people that are not very strong in English. and then you're going to have international people like us that are very basic in Spanish. I think it's really difficult to do in both lessons. That would be wonderful if it's possible, but I think it will be impossible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Normally that doesn't work. Very well. So I think it will be better in English and we can try the language change that's the okay great great so yeah for the first event because the things you said are all great right but it is more founder focused. Yes.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, the thing is my brain is very founder brain. So, yeah, I can see that because we want the other digital nomads to feel welcome and it's great to have those events where digital nomads can come and feel inspired. Yes.  But you also want them to feel welcome and just feel a community around them. Feel like they're having drinks with their colleagues, which is a lot of what we're missing. Agree. I think for so long that maybe the first step is open to digital normal and then if you see that there is a lot of founders or try another event center for founders. Yeah, it's possible. Yeah. Yeah. For sure.
00:25:00
Peter Moriarty: And I think anything can be suitable for both. A mastermind can be I don't know. do you mean digital nomads that are entrepreneurs or digital nomads that might be remote workers? We wanted to be able to attract Brianda's target audience. You want to be to open. Yeah. No, that makes sense to me. I'm just trying to I would have to change my thinking a little bit with some of the events because I think very entrepreneur  Yeah, we can do it this way because it can still be inspiring for someone to kind of either listen to a business owner or listen to a business owner's problems, it's still interesting to learn okay, this is what that person's struggling with, you can talk to someone in the crowd, maybe and some people who are working for someone else, they have a side gig or they have, ambition to start their own business. So, that can always work. I completely agree.
Peter Moriarty: But considering that we have less than a week to plan this first event, I think we need to focus on that one first. Yeah, we should do something really For next week, something simple. Something that can be open to the public. So, your events that you're running on Wednesday because I haven't seen that advertised, but I'm not on Facebook. It's not advertised because it's not advertised. This one. Okay. So, this is more private. yeah. Yeah. Really? Okay.
Peter Moriarty: That's okay, great. That we're not doubling up. I have the advertised for the events that I did before. I did once with Lydia, for example, the girl that I told you about because that was each one has a theme. That was for people who wants to that they hate their professional life, but they're afraid to change and she changed for three times is that it's okay.
Peter Moriarty: It's not a problem to prevent it because you changed your life and Lydia inspired a lot of people with her story and the Amaya was another type of story and Amaya speak very very well English. So that would be a great people to invite for an event for founders digital no because she created the gravity wave that  I invite her to Wednesday but she can't make it but sometimes she goes to visit the place and it was a different story and I have a English friend who I want interview him because his story is very nice.
Peter Moriarty: He study for do something sport s like t-shirt all those body stuff and he start to work on Hollister the magazine then he was the manager of the store but he didn't start the business and then he was one of the major directors Tesla in the Mediterranean coast. Wow. So he was so close from here. He's nomad right now. Sometimes he's here, sometimes. Yeah, exactly. And I want him to come to one of our events to tell us his story because I don't know if you read the book.
Peter Moriarty: If you read the book, how do you say in English? The monk who sold his bro. Yes, I've read that. Yeah. one day he was like, "Okay, I'm so tired to have this Tesla. I earn a lot of money, but this is not the life that I want for me." And he quit. And with a van.  He has his own boat and he's saving a lot and he's really happy.
Peter Moriarty: He told me that you have no pain again to go like okay okay you have your months for free vacation okay is coming and that takes grace yeah yeah have that decision and to reint wasn't there a lady that we met at who was in I want to say Mercedes she was  working as brand something. I don't remember. Lady with short hair. We met her at the business branch too. She was the one who invited us for the first time. No. she lives in Denya. she just moved here when we met her. And yeah, her story is kind of similar.
00:30:00
Peter Moriarty: worked with this big car company and just quits everything and she's starting her I want to say coaching independent consultancy thing yeah okay I understand yeah yeah so we have I know some people who speak English very fluent in their founders yeah I can do that too I can do the speaking thing, but I think we're going to try and, build some events first and then of course. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, the first one, what's it going to be? So, it will probably be next Friday late afternoon. That's the only time we have before we go, Yes. We're flying The next Sunday or Monday? I think. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: You think it's going to be too close because maybe one week to announce the No, it's good. Yeah. You think it's going to work? One week. Maybe. We'll see. Wow. let's think about it. So, yeah. I think we have one week to promote it. we can put together the images and the event page today. That's easy.  We can use Gemini for that. I think the question is what? Put it on Instagram. Of course, we could do Instagram, spend $100 on ads, promote it, that kind of thing. I think the question would be and we could even use this as a launch opportunity for Cal Digital as Yes. of course. Yeah. Yeah. So, this is an opportunity to we'll post in partnership to partners. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, this is Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: we can launch that too. and so yeah, the question is like what kind of event would we want to do? Something that's accessible. I think because it's nearly Christmas time, it has to be something that doesn't feel very high commitment. I think something that feels like a bit of a break in all the chaos before Christmas.  So yeah, something that's not something that people are not too that doesn't feel like a commitment to people because busy work week, blah blah blah or big travel plans coming up. maybe something like pre- holiday connection because I'm kind of thinking we're going to go away for Christmas, right?
Peter Moriarty: And lots of people are going to be busy for Christmas. But I would like to see our friends before we go away for Christmas. We can just do Early Christmas party. it could be an early Christmas party. Yeah. it's going to be December 5. so could be early. The Christmas party usually, has a whole bunch of Christmasy themed stuff and like that It might be a bit too much effort.  So maybe in spirit, Pre Christmas party for There Pre Christmas connect. We'll find a name. Yeah. But that's the vibe. Pre Christmas connect.
Peter Moriarty: and what we suggested doing if you do a sunset drinks or something like that and you have a whole bunch of people in the room. If you say come to a networking event people get really scared because they think someone's going to put a business card in my face or anything like that. No no that's not good.  But if you have a whole bunch of people in a room and you have prompt question cards and you have someone facilitate that and then it's like cool walk find someone you haven't stand with them. grab the prompt card. All right. And then you're going to ask them a question. What's the biggest challenge you've overcome in your business this week? Or what are your plans for 2026?
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, I think more casual stuff would be better. Especially if it's after work, it's a Friday. Do you really want to be thinking, " my god, about that." yeah, we can do a couple of light things like that because remember that connects people. I'm not saying we have to do that, but something like that is nice when you have a bunch of people maybe with How your entire Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I guess what you're happy that or what you accomplish I don't know this year. I like that. Yeah What are you proud of yourself this year? Right. Because normally we grow but we just focus on the bad things.
00:35:00
Peter Moriarty: Is it like shed or So my question to you Brianda is in which space are you willing to I don't know or do you want to use for this event? I just make it the other one because we can prepare as we want.  We can remove the tables and with few by as we wish. So maybe we can aim for 20 to 30 people. Is that too many? No. No, that's And we can ask people to RSVP. Yeah, of course. Yeah, because
Peter Moriarty: Yeah. Or I don't know. It should be a small payment. Absolute minimum 10. Yeah. 10 entry. Yeah. And that does have Drinks and little snacks. and then I think this would be such a good way to get rid of all my bread. I bake sourdough because I like the process of baking and there's only so much pizza and meat. So I cut it in half. I put some in the freezer and also my freezer is full of freshly baked bread. Yeah. Yeah. So there's lots of bread. So okay.
Peter Moriarty: what about a pre Christmas connect and vision for 2026. Mhm. So a little bit starting to think about your next year but also a little bit of reflection. So 2025 reflection 2026 vision. I think that's a good idea to include in some of the questions. Mhm. But I want to say not exciting as an event when we see this posts on Facebook which events do we feel excited to go to? It's a Good question. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: Do we want to go to a room full of people and reflect on the year with strangers? I think for me my idea for a first event is to focus on the community building that hey we are creating a community here. Watch out for next year because we'll be creating all these digital entrepreneurs and founders up. What is that? As easy as that. pre Christmas meet up or mixer beer. Mix Yeah. Yeah. Pre Christmas meet up and And I'm thinking about you just said that normally to just connect with people that you don't know. For me it's the same. Normally the vis is because there's something like a hook to see.
Peter Moriarty: for example, something to draw them in. Exactly. It's like ga. Sometimes I want to yoga not because the yoga because of the group, but I don't want the group so you have the offer of a free day pass, So we can say to people, hey, on offer is a free day pass, but you could probably give away one person could win a month pass. Something like that, Cuz you can give that away for free easy, Yeah. So you can say, okay, that's really good one person will get a one month free pass to the working for something. Okay. Yeah. they're looking a raffle. Yeah. Yeah. We just put their names in. you have a chance to win. Yeah. Okay. That's nice. Everyone with ADHD loves to gamble, so perfect. Yeah.
00:40:00
Peter Moriarty: I'm planning to be another event not in Spanish cool with a girl who wants to create the event and she was focused on and I say no the people's like let's do it of course you do need to meet people but this is what I'm saying you want to
Peter Moriarty: have something fun. I like that. get your 2026 tarot reading. Yeah. Yeah. And it doesn't have to be done. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. that's really cool. But something that people want to do with other people, strangers that's not embarrassing, but it's like, " my god, that group was so fun." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. and I was thinking some type of game, but I don't know a game that 30 people can participate, right? there's a million facilitated games that we'll find something with AI. We can do that. Yeah. Example, Shark the focus on the running, but for them it was the community that they doing through the running. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: You just want some activity that everybody can do together or do individually but in the same space like the painting or the ceramics like people journalist but there is no more serious that's more serious but yeah people love to go to those places because it feels like we're in class together maybe you travel with your seatmate and then vibe see social
Peter Moriarty: community building expert. Yeah. I want to show you one of them. when is happening? When the tarot event I haven't the dates but I think we're going to announce them on January but doing on Cool. But I don't know. I'm going to ask her if she speak English so we can recreate another version in English.  That would be nice. Yeah, because it's mysterious. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. It's exciting. I don't know what kind of activity it would be. what I think. Don't think too hard. I really think if we said this is a end of year meetup. Yeah. I really digital nomads founders questions that maybe we can even just project
Peter Moriarty: project the question. of course. yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy. Yeah. Yeah. so you need someone with a microphone or a loud voice and I can cover that and you just say, "Okay, All right. we're going to do a few connection exercises. Many people are new here. this is a new community. I'm sure you all want to get to know each other. So, going to ask you to find someone that you haven't met Might be a little bit awkward. That's okay. You're right. Go and find them. Stand in front of them. Everyone got someone? All right.  So, we got a couple of prompt questions here for you and we're going to get you having some conversations so you learn a little bit about the person in front of you. Then we get the questions up, they do the thing. 15 minutes absolute maximum and then let them go back to the night. it is per group. So the people couldn't together. it would just be a prompt question What are you proud of yourself this year?
Peter Moriarty: what challenges have you overcome what are you looking forward to next year that's it as simple people love to talk like that's enough the people you think that they're going not to be embarrassed nah that's fine we'll make it I want to say my calming voice and my enthusiastic energy yeah I want to say your questions are a bit too serious okay we can like something my god we'll start with something we'll start with
Peter Moriarty: This is one of the parties parties that manag they put the ice bucket challenge. The first thing was Nice. Then J. Ice bucket challenge. That's a lot here in Cape. No, that was in because when they create each mag each store that they have it's because it's a franchise or something. Nice.  That's cool. we couldn't buy yan for some DJ. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Our friend is DJ. Yeah. Yeah. We could start the night with the prompt questions. Move on to Let people chitchat before I don't know like some DJing.
00:45:00
Peter Moriarty: But we don't even have to have the event so long. Maybe it's easier for people to come as well if it's not a 5 hour day. no, no. I'm thinking late late afternoon starts at 400 p.m. Maybe. and two three hours. It's when people work 7 p.m. maybe we should make it 7 p.m. then. Normally here is 7. That's why the activities start. All we'll go with seven. We'll go with 7 p.m. And then if they want to go out or do dinner or something, they can still go. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Exactly. what would be the hook for the people if meet beers DJ digital for Christmas party? What would people pay €10 for the drinks?
Peter Moriarty: Look, I think €10 just covers the drinks in the event space. I think that's good enough. I think the hook is if you're here and you haven't met the community, this is how you will meet the community. And I think there should be an expectation that 10 bucks covers the cost of the drinks and the space. We can make a five if you really want, but yeah, I think 10 10 should 10 is performing tennis. and then do you usually advertise your events? Do you spend any money on Facebook or anything for them or you're just doing just posting on my pages and that's it. Okay. And your ads who's doing your ads?
Peter Moriarty: and it's digital in Barcelona agency and as they are in Barcelona normally they gave me the strategy and gave me what they teach they have to say and then I send them. great. so you do the video you just present the videos. Yeah. Yeah. I see her all the time.  I'm getting hit with your ads so much that I thought that it would be good for me to tell you that hey maybe limit your targeting but but you're the target market. No, but you frequency because I've already been to the page it's not to spend more money on me.
Peter Moriarty: I don't know why Instagram's I don't know if they can control the people that already see the videos because I don't know. You can. Yeah. I need to Ask them because I get hit with three, four or five a day. there might not be many people in the demo in Calpay that the target is probably too narrow for the spend which is a challenge. And how would they verify that you're a customer?
Peter Moriarty: But you're logging into a portal, Yes. Yeah. I think I've been to the website at least. So I think if you exclude people who visited your website in the last 30 days, I think that's So it's 7 p.m. 2 to three hours. make it Sure. 6:30. Yeah.  two to three hours. so we have Pre Christmas meetup and mixer. So we say beer mix or pre Christmas something like that. Mix and beer or pre Christmas. we'll think about something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: so the activity who's going to I can facilitate it. I love facilitating. So I'm happy to facilitate. Yep. We can share a bit about our story. I said we came here in January. We had no one. And for the people to sign up is We'll give them a checkout form. That's easy. yeah. Do you have a Stripe account or a Square or something like that? Yeah, Stripe account. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we can use yours or we can use mine. I don't really mind. That's fine. I mean, the money is going to go to you for the drinks and things. We don't have any costs, do we? If you want to advertise We might spend some money on ads. That would be good. If you want, what can I do? I can't run of the advertise.
00:50:00
Peter Moriarty: I just can send to my team because I think that they're not doing because already paid for the month that you can circle cycle it and perfect. Yeah, that would be great. Maybe I can ask them to create the publicity. Yeah, that would be good. Yeah. And then once we have our page up, we can do some collaboration posts.  So you can add us to the post and then it will appear on both profiles. about you. I mean if it's individual or you have a name or mobile or we're creating digital digital. Yeah. Yeah, it's digital on Instagram.
Peter Moriarty: So, okay, I'm going to ask to the thing to create it and we'll spend a small budget on ads maybe on our page as well or we just let Brianna's guys do it. I want to say let's try putting it on all the Calvin groups first. And see the response we Launch the groups. we're putting it on her ads because she's already paying them for the money. but what I need for you is what they're going to put in the ads because I think that it we can create a brief. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: create a brief message because they speak English. So, I guess the next question is since we're asking them for an entrance fee like you might have some profit. but are you okay with providing that food and drinks or I know that's a lot of work. With the space for It's free and I think it will be with the money that they already pay that you can buy the drinks. So I think Yeah. Yeah. How many people do you normally have and what do you normally spend?
Peter Moriarty: What's your normal budget? Just so we have an idea. I go to the form because I Great. I think it was like No, I have to speak. Okay. So, 20 people. Easy. Yeah. Space is free. yeah.  I guess the question is I don't mind spending a couple hundred bucks of our money to grow our stuff. but probably starting organic to get an idea to test the water first is a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like that.
Peter Moriarty: I think we can keep the costs minimal by just chips. Maybe even pizza. Yeah, I was thinking that One mirror. Hey, Yeah, a little bit of beer and a pizza. Yeah, so it's easy for us.  And yeah, maybe have some grapes. Yeah, you'd want to have a couple of snacks there and then you have the meal you'd have the pieces delivered later so they're In total, I just sent 260. Easy. For one event. Yeah. Okay, And I have eight 18 people.
Peter Moriarty: 18 And they didn't pay anything. Yeah. But I think that's going to change for the next year. I have a lot of expenses. So Yeah.  And before it was understandable because the wasn't finished with everything the battle does have dollar is that they money but now that's really yeah because this is a very nice space.
Peter Moriarty: And they're already getting so much value from me. Yeah. I give a lot of things on it because sometimes I pay the contest for per book. I have a lot of books to give 14 per person it cost me. you still What would be awesome if we collaborate with someone who picked the drinks that I don't know the tender guy, Max. yeah. Our friend is a mobile bartender. They do have a competing spa. They have a co-l livingiving space.
00:55:00
Peter Moriarty: I guess it's not really co-working, it's co-l livingiving, We can ask them. Yeah. Yeah. I don't They have a space in Denia. l livingiving it's called. I'm gonna ask a girl who because I have for the tarot and wines. Someone give me the contact of a girl who normally the dream to collaborate and to  I wonder it's like a winery will give us wine. Or a restaurant that can do it at wholesale rates instead of retail. Booze is cheaper too. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's like €2 for Yeah, that's not so bad. Yeah, I see. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: But that would be nice to have sponsors in the future. We can, promote local entrepreneurs, even a German restaurant that has a brewery in the back. yeah, that would be perfect. We could ask them. but what they will earn publicity for their business? Because I can speak with Andy the guy I told you they have 10 restaurants here.  M I think later when we do big events then we'll ask them. save that one for now. In the end the more people that we attract to the more customers they will have to That's true. Yeah. Especially if we're promoting it on YouTube and making public space. And their production costs are pretty minimal.
Peter Moriarty: So I think so it's not like they're giving us a,000 euros worth of beer, It's like what? 50. so I think the 10 that I'm going to pay is going to be enough. It's not. yeah. If we get 20. Okay.  If you want, I keep for the first event I can put the drinks and then with the money that we earn for the event I gave the invoice with the invoice so after this event what we're going to spend I have the fridge so I have some beverage that
Peter Moriarty: From the company. yeah, we have no costs. So, yeah, we're just happy to try and make as much money as possible on the tickets. I guess you get the upside that maybe some people will become customers. so yeah, that works for us in the future. I mean, yeah, we're not trying to make money from this. there's no way to make money with events like this. I think we're lucky if we cover our costs. that's what Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's all. It's just cost price basically. But that's this event we have to pay for the drinks event. sure. So then for the next one. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Easy. Okay. Okay.
Peter Moriarty: So we have a publicity the dreams. We can do this for the payments. You can add it on the form. Yeah. Then there's no processing fee. That's better. Yeah. Okay. and are you still okay with the price month? Yeah.  one can't be two weeks or Okay. What do you think it will be Exciting. I think a one month pass is pretty exciting. It cost you zero. So we going to just need Just one. Yeah. one person will win one month. Yeah. And maybe two people can win a week if you want. But up to you. Or I don't know. Is there something else? What else do you sell?
01:00:00
Peter Moriarty: just space or space but I have rchansing. cool. I can give to Yeah, Okay. Yeah, two tote bags. Maybe even give a voucher for a one day rental for the boardroom or something like that. So, if somebody wants to, have an event, you can give a voucher. Completely up to you. Yeah, I will give you some great as much as you want. Amazing.'s Yeah, that's maybe like a bring a friend voucher. But if they can come, I mean I guess so they should bring a friend. Yeah. So do you offer the free day pass as per trial?
Peter Moriarty: But maybe, returning customers "Yeah, bring a friend for free." I thought I'd bring a friend to the event. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Okay. But if you bring a friend for the next event, you have two tickets for the next Something like that. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. It's like a game.  So we try things and then if this works are we going to do it this not and then we make the goal to fill the room in a future events. Yeah. Yeah. That would be good. I mean we used to have events in Davao. Remember it's a small city where Z is from and there is founder events there and they put them on every month and it's kind of it's a small town.
Peter Moriarty: the startups are not very good. it's a startup community, but maybe No, It's a small city, but there's 50 60 people in the room. it gets busy and that's pretty impressive. Now, there's a lot of students there. Yeah. that aren't real business to be able to inspire them. Yeah. But it's a startup event. this is actually going to be a more targeted at dig entrepreneurs. and we're going to have events on the groups that you're going to put them on Instagram. yeah and we'll need to start that tonight but we can do the copy for that tonight. You can images.
Peter Moriarty: I mean the traditional way some posters or what do you think about that's a good idea about that in I've never done that before we could ask we're friends with the owners of nail gym Neo gym Lisa Lisa and Steven that own that Zoe  Lisa. Yes, we were at the opening and I want to meet him. He comes one day. I was the slow so This place is actually perfect for him. he would be great to have as a guest presenter because he coaches highlevel executives. He's a, professional bu bodybuilder as well.
Peter Moriarty: so, yeah. Yeah, That's a good space to put up a poster for Maybe even Morris Boris's restaurant. yeah. Yeah. I wonder how much printing costs for some flyers. Don't you need to just print the color page? Yeah, Yeah, but on I got the video here. Doesn't have to be a proper paper.  It just needs something.
Peter Moriarty: I put in some places near to the beach and station as Nice. So I put some in my husband business of course. is this for an event? Yeah. Okay. So there's people posting posters.  bus station office. So we would want to do cafes because that's Samios yes nail where else do nomads hang out plant shack. So we have to do it on Monday because it's on Friday the activity is over. Yeah.
01:05:00
Peter Moriarty: and post on I think online tonight or tomorrow. Yeah, we'll try to send you a copy tonight for the ad. We need an event page. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe from the transcript we can give her a brief of them. And we want to create a group on WhatsApp for the people who comes on Friday to continue connect to the  So, we'll put them in the cup digital group. Yeah. Yeah. So, we'll set up a special one for this, but yeah, that'll be in the C digital group. So, it will be there codes so they can Of course. We should put that in the flyers. QR. So, they can register. Quickly. what else?
Peter Moriarty: So this is this Friday. 20 tickets. And we can invite friends. And we can invite friends as well. And we'll ask friends friends to pay. Minimum 20. Minimum 20. Yeah, that's the goal. That's the KPI. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that will be easy. Yeah. Yeah. We can make it happen.  And of course please invite your friends as well even if there will be some people who speak Spanish. I tell to the people who Speak English. All right. Let me ask the AI. What else are we missing in our planning of this event?
Peter Moriarty: the publicity on Monday, you will have Instagram because I don't think that this time the people from marketing going to help. We need a finalized event name and promotional copy. So, we'll have a brief for the ads agency. Two, we need an event page and registration. needs a checkout form.  So we'll get a Google form or something like that and you want to make an Instagram account for the community. we have already And you want to send me the link? Of course. Yeah. So good collaboration. finalizing giveaways, but you've already decided what you want to give. So that sounds good. drinks and snacks coordination.
Peter Moriarty: Maybe we can have a Google when I run events usually have one Google sheet and on the Google sheet it has everything we need. So contacts a Google spreadsheet. yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Okay. Okay. we just need one to share all information to coordinate the event. Yeah. So we could see the same time. and then community group setup. That's for us to motion Begin promoting the event on the local groups.
Peter Moriarty: And you're going to call with your DJ friend? Yes. And we will speak to Jean and see if he's here, if he's available. Otherwise, maybe we can invite this chick from DA Oliver's friends who sings cover bands. I don't know. who is that? I don't  Remember Oliver from Switzerland? He's connected with a lot of Okay. yeah. what? We could easily just find 20 of our friends to bring together in this with all the people that we've met. But even the Switch on Valley group, I guess they're pretty digital. Yeah, We can invite them. Yeah, they're just a bit older.
Peter Moriarty: They're at least 20 years older than that. But that's okay. we said the first people that we want is just to get people here, build a community. no one wants a party that's dead, So, it's better that we have some, extra people here just to get their community started and then we get good photos, we get good video, and then other people get FOMO, so that's what we want to build. yeah, lots of groups. so I'm going to invite a couple of the people who have been working during this day. perfect. And you have an email list of some you can email it to the email list. Great. and where do you normally put events? Do you put it on your partner's page on the Facebook page or somewhere else? Okay.
01:10:00
Peter Moriarty: You did it on my Instagram. I have to do it in my website and I don't do it. And we talk. we're going to create a meetup for Cal Digital. So, we'll use that. we do that meet up. We can do it another way. And I saw that you have a profile. yes. I signed up I think for the app. It was six months ago. So, I don't know. Really?  You see all the people who is over there. I did it obviously for I came here perspective time and I just try to see which people is here so I can see. Okay, this will be a potential client because lives in Hold on. Where is that? It's on the top of the my god.
Peter Moriarty: So you can view all. yeah, you should definitely put it there. Brianda. So You can post the event That what they want because it's like you have the live couch surfing. yeah, they have a lot of things over there. So there is for alle.  So they can put a need if they will be able to attend to the event. Okay, we'll post on Nomad one thing that I want and you said the owners of Nomadway. Yeah. Could you connect us with the owners? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because may I want to chat to them and see if maybe maybe they'll help promote the event. I mean I guess we'll list it on here that you could just explain. Sorry.
Peter Moriarty: They have the apps because they create their own group on Facebook as well. One of them that is private. I saw that. Yeah. So digital something like that. It's very similar for the other one is public and they create their own community but around the nomad way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That they have. That's cool.  And for example, one day what I want to create I want to create I don't know if you want to participate a co-working session here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great working sessions. Yes. Yeah. Because what I want to is I put it here a Friday you can come from 9 at the beginning with some breakfast here. We share together we introduce ourselves then focus Monday four hours. I don't know.
Peter Moriarty: Then we can eat together and then after work. Yeah, that's so good. I love that. And I'm going to talk with Cafe or Andy to do after one of the bar so we can have great prices because they propel me to do after That's so good. Perfect. Yeah, that sounds great. Let's do it.  And the person who's in charge of this is the owner. He was the one who told me made a work decision. Yeah. India. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. That sounds perfect. Yeah. It's strange. It's not super busy the Nomad group in Alante. I think I have his contact on LinkedIn. Great. Thank you.
Peter Moriarty: I can send you his profile because normally I exchange me through LinkedIn and he's very active on LinkedIn. And you can say Brianna from partners working wow make friends and blah blah language exchange elicante every Tuesday 625 people responded. Wow it's like a meet up for digital nomads.  Yeah, they only accept digital. this would be good. global events blah blah community.com. Let me look at that. Meet new people, make friends organizing the summit in for digital nomads. we could host those here as well. We could host language exchange nights, I guess.
01:15:00
Peter Moriarty: one of the thing I want to do it after we create the first event for the community, we can do dinner from countries. I mean this month is going to be Dominican Republic for example. It each country from the community is going to be in charge of the winner. For me Dominican  and we're going to have I love that typical United Nations food from Dominican Republic.
Peter Moriarty: You can ask if someone is eager to go and then from Australia and then from Philippines it's not like a different country theme event. You have food, music, everything. Yeah, that's great. I knew a girl who made it on in her co-working space in Barcelona and it is six. Yeah.  And for example is today Japan. They put everything on the floor. They create that sounds weird. You are Japan. the presentation of Japan, everything. You can do for example the last Friday or Thursday everybody is waiting for that day because that day we have to travel to another country. That's one of the ideas. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: maybe eventually and they make entrepreneur  the first Monday of each month in the community of her working space from the people who works there and they invite people from outside there's the moment of that person for example during meetings we going to share together and it is C who's going to tell us what you do see because go okay I share with you we play with but I don't know exactly what your professional lives and
Peter Moriarty: the next month another one and another one that's a lot of ideas but yeah yeah I think it would be good to get an intern or assistant or someone who can help put these things together maybe a student who wants to work on their resume yeah we can find someone to help thinking is to have a coworker post so that if a person need a
Peter Moriarty: space to work, but he didn't. yeah. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. the camping hosts when we were traveling. Remember someone would get free spot at the campsite, but they were the camp host. That's how host really? nice. You get bored and I think, but you have to do the guided tours. You have to lead us through the pow crawl.  Yeah, because I have to get out from here because I need to business. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I can do five here all the days and that's what I need and what he can have the place for free but I need I don't know eight hours. Yeah. Here.
Peter Moriarty: You can put your stuff during your year, but That's the idea.' your friend Caitlyn. she would be great for that. She's very sweet. I would like to. Very nice. Yeah, you would like to meet her. We'll invite her next week. perfect. Yeah, she speak Spanish as well.  She's Learning. Her partner is Spanish. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. he's from here. He lived in Australia, but I would like to speak to her. They're very good. this is looking good. So, we have five ideas of the first one, then the language exchange, the entrepreneur, the countries dinner.
Peter Moriarty: Yeah, the co-working station. And if we start making money, maybe we just share the profit in the future. if we start making a hundred bucks or 200 bucks or something, then we just start sharing or we put the money back into a fund to pay for the future events. that's the other way. Or to pay for advertising the events. Yeah. We don't because we don't need money from this. It's fine. if we pay for the pay for the events and I think that for me it's not to spend more money. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's okay for me. okay. If you want I can ask to Jean the founder of Nam Way or I just can maybe send me his details. I think we'll wait till we get this. Yeah actually. Yeah.
01:20:00
Peter Moriarty: if you could send me his details that would be amazing and I'll reach out and just say hey how can we work together normally he respond very quickly to because you're the same as us these are so good I love the white chocolate one I really like it it's like I don't know a suit
Peter Moriarty: Thank you. then pizza and then this is on February dinner is going to be the day of right. Perfect. or I've seen this in social media but we can host a singles night. Yeah. And I've seen this on social media like people present their friend, right?
Peter Moriarty: They're putting on the projector this is what makes this person amazing, my god, that's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. But it would be so good before Valentine. So they get Before Valentine' That's the February event. Yes. Yeah. that's Football night. I don't say football, but I'm going to take the pictures in the beer. Hey, if you do you have a projector or something? You do. Okay, Yeah, perfect. Yeah, use that. I suggested to we can do movie nights, but he said that you can't do that in commercial setting.
Peter Moriarty: you're not supposed to show movies, so if we do movie nights, you just have to be careful about it. Yeah. Yeah. Because someone asked me the same the other Spanish, they told me, " good idea." Yeah. Popcorn and drink. We have everything microwave. It just has to be more private. once we've got the community, then it has to be more private.  We can't say, "Hey, we're going to show the Matrix on Friday night here." Because then, we'll get in trouble. So, you're willing to do it one per week? Always a lot. I think eventually if there's enough people. I mean, we have five week days in a week and sometimes we don't have something to do. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: So that Yeah, I think two per month is great. and if there's something every week I guess it depends how much people might be too many. Yes. Yeah. And these are people that we want to hang out as well. Some places are so busy there's something happening two three times a week. That's true.
Peter Moriarty: So, they're really big hubs. Yeah, we have to see in January how many people are actually here and you have to make sure this works for your business. That on January was the date a lot of people come. I don't know if it's true to happen. I don't know. I mean, we arrived in January, but I think that was just The people from Canada, they told me the same. And they have friends that they knew that as Interesting. Alissa and Caitlyn also arrived in January. Okay. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: it is the quiet time. we were in Mexico. we knew that it was a good time to find property. because it's very difficult in May, June, it's impossible. So we thought we'll come in the low season and it's easier to find property. That's why maybe everyone had the same conversation with Found it January people. Okay.
Peter Moriarty: No, I Could you share with me the Canadian couple's contacts? Yeah, Don't forget. Yeah, I will ask her, but for sure she's going to tell me. I told you they're going to be She's very nice. She's learning Spanish. So, she told me, "Please talk to me in Spanish." But then five minutes later, she  Z is the same. I speak one of the languages of the Philippines and Z will just always speak to me in English. Yeah. Or we practice in Spanish with each other. You practice Spanish between you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. hers is better than mine, but yeah, we practice a little bit.
01:25:00
Peter Moriarty: Eipina. Is that this is exciting. I think we can do this one on Friday and then when you're going to the church? I think mid maybe 20th of January around then. But maybe not much earlier.
Peter Moriarty: No, about the 20th of January, but we can organize remotely. Okay, that's because it's good to have the event for So, January, we have to plan ahead three weeks ahead, I think. Yeah. Yeah, we can start advertising from while we're there. Yeah, of course. That's why. So, if you want, we can just focus on this one and when it's finished, we plan to a meeting. in January we can ask people, what do you want to achieve for 2020? Yeah, that's going to be nice. I remember when I moved to Tal and my mother-in-law, she introduced me a girl who just moved from Chile.
Peter Moriarty: And I remember the first time that I saw her because they want okay it's good to meet that girl because For me it was okay. I need friends. Yeah. And I asked her what do you want to do here in cafe? And she told me I want to be your friend. I was inseparable.  That's good. It's been five years after that. That's so sweet. I always talk about I never going to forget. So, we can create an event and we can have it on both of our pages. Great. Great. Okay.
Peter Moriarty: you just add it there that girls nights or girls brunches or whatever girls events would be also good. And for that I have a lot of ideas but because I know a lot of people that we can do collaboration to invite them to do some special thing. Yes. Even some people who do like a makeup workshop. Yes. I have a lot who wants to do that. So we can to have it as waxing. No. Yeah. Makeup like flower like painting. Maybe we can collaborate with an Knitting crochet. Yeah. we can do a lot of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Moriarty: because I have a group of girls we are in one WhatsApp and we meet up now everybody's traveling all the time so we don't meet up as much but yeah we want to do wine tasting somewhere and yeah just really I did propose one of the companies who text me to do something together it was one focus yeah something
Peter Moriarty: for the beauty thing and she told me I can give you one day here for free so you can put in your social media or people okay okay let's do this December is the weird month so it's on January so together right I don't know if they speak  English. I can ask. We'll find out. So, we were thinking yeah, if our project goes we want to maybe do a podcast here. so, we would love to film here if you're open to that. And we could make the podcast we can say sponsored by Kalp partners working. Yeah.
01:30:00
Peter Moriarty: She's got great stage presence. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But we'd love to interview people here, talk about their business, And then share it on social media and maybe share it on social Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We can interview you. and that's little snippets for social media as well. So yeah, later later on. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.  I know that's a great bring over your gear. Shall we look at the space? Maybe turn the lights on and have a very quick walk through.
